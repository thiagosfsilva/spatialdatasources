# Am ever-growing compendium of sources for spatial data.

I am compiling this list to support my students on GIS/Geomatics courses at University of Stirling (hence the stronger UK/EU focus), but hopefully it will be helpful to other people as well. 

Feel free to submit suggestions as issues or pull requests! The only requirement is that the source can be tied to a reputable real-world data provider (government agency, NGO, known company, etc.). I would particularly appreciate links from national and state agencies for different countries!
